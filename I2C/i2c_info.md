# üì° I¬≤C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) Communication Protocol

## üß† What is I¬≤C?

**I¬≤C** (pronounced *I-squared-C* or *I-two-C*) stands for **Inter-Integrated Circuit**. It‚Äôs a **synchronous**, **multi-master**, **half-duplex**, **two-wire** communication protocol designed to connect **multiple ICs (chips)** over short distances, typically on a **PCB**.

## üîå I¬≤C Bus Basics

| Line Name | Function                          |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| **SDA**   | Serial Data (bidirectional)       |
| **SCL**   | Serial Clock (generated by master)|

- Only **two wires** are needed for communication.
- Devices are identified using **7-bit or 10-bit addresses**.
- Supports **multiple masters and slaves** on the same bus.

---

## üß± I¬≤C Roles

- **Master**: Initiates communication and generates clock (SCL).
- **Slave**: Responds to master‚Äôs request; each has a unique address.

> You can have **many slaves**, and sometimes even **multiple masters**.

## üß© I¬≤C Data Frame Format

I¬≤C communicates in **messages** composed of **frames**, with each frame consisting of 8 bits + 1 ACK bit.

### üßµ General I¬≤C Transfer

```
[START] ‚Üí [ADDRESS + R/W] ‚Üí [ACK] ‚Üí [DATA BYTE] ‚Üí [ACK] ‚Üí ... ‚Üí [STOP]
```

### üß± Frame Breakdown

| Section           | Description                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **START**         | Master pulls SDA LOW while SCL is HIGH   |
| **ADDRESS**       | 7 bits for slave address                 |
| **R/W Bit**       | 1 = Read, 0 = Write                      |
| **ACK/NACK**      | Acknowledgment bit from slave/master     |
| **DATA BYTE**     | 8 bits of data                           |
| **STOP**          | Master releases SDA while SCL is HIGH    |

## üîÑ Read vs Write Transaction

### üñãÔ∏è Write Example (Master to Slave)

```
START ‚Üí [ADDR + 0] ‚Üí ACK ‚Üí [DATA1] ‚Üí ACK ‚Üí [DATA2] ‚Üí ACK ‚Üí STOP
```

### üìñ Read Example (Slave to Master)

```
START ‚Üí [ADDR + 1] ‚Üí ACK ‚Üí [DATA1] ‚Üí ACK ‚Üí [DATA2] ‚Üí NACK ‚Üí STOP
```

- Master sends a **NACK** after final byte to signal **end of read**.

## üß∞ I¬≤C Usage & Applications

| Application                     | Examples                        |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Sensor communication**         | MPU6050, BMP280, BH1750         |
| **Real-time clocks (RTC)**       | DS1307, DS3231                  |
| **EEPROM / Flash memory**        | AT24C32, 24LC256                |
| **Displays**                     | OLEDs, LCDs with I¬≤C backpacks  |
| **GPIO expanders**               | PCF8574, MCP23017               |

## üìå I¬≤C Device Addressing

- Devices are assigned **7-bit addresses** (some use 10-bit).
- Some address bits may be configurable via **hardware pins (A0‚ÄìA2)**.
- For a 7-bit address like `0x68`, the write address is `0xD0`, and read is `0xD1` (appended with R/W bit).

## üìâ I¬≤C Speed Modes

| Mode          | Max Speed     |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Standard**  | 100 kHz       |
| **Fast**      | 400 kHz       |
| **Fast+**     | 1 MHz         |
| **High-speed**| 3.4 MHz       |

## üß™ I¬≤C Real-World Example (MPU6050)

### üß© Steps to Read from a Register

1. Master sends START
2. Sends slave address with write bit (0)
3. Sends register address to read
4. Sends REPEATED START
5. Sends slave address with read bit (1)
6. Reads data byte(s)
7. Sends STOP

> This is called a **repeated start** condition.

## üõ†Ô∏è I¬≤C Wiring Example (Master and 2 Slaves)

```
        Master
        +-----+
SDA --->|     |
SCL --->|     |
        +-----+
           |
        +--+--+
        |     |
      +----+ +----+
      | S1 | | S2 |
      +----+ +----+

(All devices share SDA & SCL lines)
```

> Devices are identified by unique **7-bit addresses**, not by separate lines like SPI.
